For my final project I really wanted to update my previous Santa game. When I designed the game the first time I didn’t use any original art. On this update, I wanted to use as much original art as possible. I was mostly successful. My game is now 90% original with the acception of the music. The music however is the opening song to the Christmas movie “Elf”, so I thought it would be perfect. When I made the first version I was thinking about myself alot. I made the game because I love christmas and I love drawing but I know I’m not the main audience. In this new iteration I also wanted to be more considerate of WHO I am making this game for? Who is my audience? I determined this audience to be creative children ages 2-8. With this new audience in mind, I wanted to center The Santa Game 2.0 around REDESIGNING. Especially because I feel I have not really taken advantage of the creative part of this creative-coding class. I started with a complete redesign of the santa character. I transformed him into a more graphic design that would be friendly and appealing to young eyes. I also changed the color scheme a little bit to be more complementary to the Santa and overall design. I also took more care on the typography of the game. I think the new font I used definitely gives more of a Christmas feel and is less robotic. I am currently also enrolled in a course at LSU called Typography and Visual Communications and it has really advanced my design work in terms of using typography in design. I had my younger cousin (6 years old) play the game and he really seemed to love it and especially loved being able to draw any kind of silly beard.
